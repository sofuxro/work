Some specs to help you. Font user is Roboto Condensed
http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto+Con...

1 - MENU
When clicked, shows a fancy drop down menu (you choose the best design for it) with this options:
* Meu perfil
* Minhas traduções (only for user role "translator")
* Legendas baixadas
* Legendas enviadas
* Sugestões enviadas

2 - SEARCH BOX
Search will suggest results while user is still typing

3 - LOGIN BOX
Sigin dropdown like twitter. Designer will send me the PSD for that.. but if you think you can make some
fancy login box, fine!

4a - When mouse hover the poster, it shows a "tool-tip" (something like "8" explanation)
4b - When user click the arrow, all four poster is changed

5 - SLIDESHOW: Sometimes we have long titles. If the title is too long like The Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring it will probably use more than 2 lines. Well, when the page loads, it will show the title break at the end of the second line. When mouse hover the title, it will show the entire title, even if it overlap some other element.
5 - BELLOW: same as above, but I think we can work with more lines before cut the text

6 & 7 & 8 & 9 - When mouse hover, it can show a fancy effect. Thats yout call :)
